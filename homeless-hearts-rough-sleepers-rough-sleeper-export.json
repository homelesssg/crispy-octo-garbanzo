He is usually at the stone bench on the lift lobby level of Block 120A Kim Tian Place. The stone bench is right next to the flight of stairs that leads down to Block 120 Kim Tian Place. He usually sleeps at the said stone bench at night. He is not there all the time but we have seen him there rather regularly for a number of months at different times of the day and different days of the week. There might be a better chance to get in touch with him on weekday nights and maybe on weekend afternoons.",

His tone was a little aggressive at first, but we told him that we can help contact the relevant government agency to help him. He refused help at first, but after repeating to him of the current situation and that we can help him to contact the right people, his tone softened. He was first seen on 10 April, around 10.45AM, sitting on the bench at Level 2 of KINEX. He has with him a 20” wheeled duffel and was wearing a black shirt. He walked off and we saw him again at around 1.45PM. After we approached him, he was courteous as we informed him we are looking for help, but he still walked away. He was then seen sitting on the bench opposite KINEX. I saw him on 11 April at around 9.00AM at the same bench; he most likely used the toilet to wash up as he was seen with a towel around his neck.",

    "homeless-appearance": "I first saw the auntie around Sept 2019 at the seats near the entrance of 888 plaza. She asked my family for assistance to order food from the tzechar stall, requesting for us to tell the tzechar stall staff to deliver food to her. Auntie says that the people there know her. However, it seems that the tzechar stall owners are unwilling to provide such assistance. Anyway we ordered and gave her dinner. Every now and then whenever I visit 888 plaza, I sometimes still see her at the same place - the seats at the entrance of 888 plaza, laying down for a rest. If I recall correctly, I saw her sleeping there once around 10pm. She will always have her big red bag of plastic bags with her. Today, I saw her again in KFC, just seated on the floor in the middle of nowhere She approached a family behind me to seek for assistance to buy food, claiming that her legs hurt. While I'm not sure what happened later between that family who helped the auntie later on, the people around her expressed concern that she wasn't wearing a mask. While I'm not completely sure whether she is homeless, I am especially concerned that she will be exposed to COVID-19 while loitering around. As I got to know of your team recently, I'm reaching out to you all who have the expertise to assess the situation and possibly help her. Thank you!",

We do apologize if we were mistaken. As we have seen a number of homeless elderly around Bedok Central before the Covid situation, we didn't know if they have been given the help they need and we were too shy and uncertain of how to help them. We're hoping by informing to a relevant and experienced organisation, we could help change their situation. Thank you.",

I had a chat with her and noticed she spoke good English, clear and coherent.  She shared that she is eating leftover vegetables as she thinks it is a waste to leave them.  She insisted on eating the leftovers, even after I bought her a fresh meal and said that it was not safe to eat from others’ plates, especially during COVID times.

    "other-notes": "I encountered and spoke to Karen when I saw her sleeping at the bench under the block at 1130pm on 14/2/21. I woke her up and offered her 10 dollars, and asked if she needs any help. She opened up that she has several medical issues and is unable to work. She has been going for cancer treatments at CGH and also some othe rmedical appointments at SGH. From what I spoke to her, I understand that she is a rough sleeper, as i think she has a house in sengkang, but she didnt go into detail as to why she doesnt reside there. She mentioned that she is single so i think she relies on govt/charity support. She shared that she applies for govt help but has to keep reapplying every 3 months and it sometimes isnt enough. More recently with the cancer treatments, she has to eat foods that are a bit more expensive, and she shared she might not have enough money to eat properly on somedays. She also opened up about her negative experiences at charities/FSCs before so i think she is also quite apprehensive about seeking help. I took down her contact and told her i'll try to find out how best I can help her, and give her a call. I hope that homeless hearts of SG can give me a hand as I am quite unsure of how to go about ensuring that she receives the long term support that she needs. Please do feel free to contact me via email/text/call if that is better. Thank you very much.",

An uncle I met said they have reported him to authorities and talked to MP report him to police. Personally I find him a nice and okay person and he is my friend. He talks offensive and rude sometimes but it’s to mask his vulnerabilities and fragile self esteem I feel. He sold me a can of abalone today cos I think he has no money to eat recently. I hope to be able to help get him off the street eventually because also of his age.
