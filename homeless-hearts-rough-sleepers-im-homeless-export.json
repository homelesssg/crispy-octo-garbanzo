I don't have a stable job at the moment, just doing casual work  as I have cataract and can't see properly . I have an eye surgery  at  Ng Teng Fong General hospital  on 1/03/2023 and after that I need 3 weeks rest at home.  \r\nSo am looking for help if you can find me accommodation as my funds won't be enough to support me after my eye operation. I can afford 300 to 400 per month rent as well , so if you can find me accommodation as per my budget through your volunteers, otherwise I just need a sleeping place  be it either in the church or any other dwelling.\r\n I will be very thankful to You for this act of kindness.\r\nD Kumar ",

My name is Muhammad Israfael Abdullah and someone from an online forum told me to approach you for help as my registered address is still based in Telok Blangah Rise. First of all, I apologise for disturbing you at this time during the festive season. \r\n\r\nMy wife and I were just thrown out from my in-laws place yesterday over some disagreements and we now don’t have a place to live in. As this was very unexpected, we don’t have much finances to deal with the circumstances we have on hand now either. We’re currently bunking in at my mum’s 2-room rental flat at Telok Blangah Rise. I can only stay here till the 26th December as my eldest brother will be back on that day after after completing his quarantine and there won’t be enough space in this house. I don’t have friends nor relatives that I can rely on. I have already applied for a rental flat from HDB which was approved on 5th November 2020 and the waiting time for it will be around 4-6 months. Going back to my in-laws place is definitely out of the question as our disagreements are longstanding and there’re some hostilities there towards myself and my wife. I’m feeling lost while writing to you and I don’t even know what to expect or what can be done in my situation. Thank you.",

It has affected my recently found new job in terms of my mental and physical state (I have a fractured wrist from a recent episode with them) and I'm now unemployed due to the disturbance.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made with social workers, policemen, counsellors, even religious faculties over the years but the situation has not become any better. In fact it has become worse— their verbal/ physical abuse, taunting and provoking have gotten worse over the years. I've left home and will only have a place to stay for a few days. It's also really sad to realise that a lot of the shelters available are for women and children only. \r\n\r\nIn full transparency, I have a DRC record and I'm determined to working on getting better but being in an already abusive family is not helping as they keep falsely accusing me of taking drugs when I did not, which was what led to our previous fight which landed me with a broken wrist and losing my (online) teaching job. I also tested negative with the drug test from that incident where they called the police.\r\n\r\nI really need help getting away from this toxic family. And my options are limited— most shelters are women and children, I'm currently unemployed and have limited savings, and am under 35 years old so I can't apply directly to HDB rental (1 or 2 room flats). I really really hope you can help me. I don't have much time left with my current arrangement of housing.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nKesavan (K7)\r\nreachingk7@gmail.com\r\n+65 87841401",

    "reasons-for-homelessness": "Basically my mum who had cancer was living in her mum’s house while undergoing treatment. I came to be with her during her final months and when she passed decided to stay on to be there for my younger sisters who were distraught. Little did we know that my grandma had put my aunts name on the house and she came to claim the house for herself, I.e kicking my sisters my dad and I out. I was married in Malaysia and told my wife my plan of buying a hen here, but having lived abroad all my life, I barely had any cpf, so I have been building it up (2k in the beginning and 16k now).  I deliver food on Grabfood/foodpanda for a living currently. \r\n\r\nAfter being kicked out of my grandmas house I stayed in Bukit Batok at the house of a friends dad. The duration agreed was 3 months but eventually stretched to 6 months. Kind of him. All the while I had been trying to save up enough money to rent a place on my own but for some unknown reason people around would intentionally attempt to slow me down in my deliveries resulting in me achieving less deliveries and earning less, barely enough to pay my bills. My dad who had been staying with my sister (who’s boyfriend sponsored her accommodation) and said I could stay there for a while. Hoping for the best I began work again. But the oppression seemed to get worse, my earnings diminished by drivers who would try to block my path in my deliveries. My sisters tenure was coming to an end and she told me I had to find my own place, so again back to work. I no longer parked my bike downstairs because it would be vandalised from time to time so I parked it in the house. But to my astonishment the vandalism got worse and just a week before my sis was moving out, 2 of my ebike wires were snipped causing the electric function not to work and me spending hours trying to fix it. Furthermore my earnings were affected by these vandalism’s as I had to sometimes spend 5-6 hours fixing my bike. Half the day or half my potential earnings gone out the window. I could not pay my phone bill and it was barred 2-3 days before I was due to move out of my sisters house. I got a prepaid card but was so busy helping my sister move her things that I did not manage to update my phone numbers on my online accounts.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is that after helping my sis move houses, I packed up my things and planned to book an Airbnb to begin with. But due to previous vandalism “attacks” in which my bikes phone holder was regularly tampered with, one of the 4 pieces of rubber holding the phone would be peeled off and as a result I dropped my phone many times and the screen strength compromised, I accidentally dropped it my self once and the screen went black. This was the night before moving out.\r\n\r\nMy sis had rented a van for her to move out and I agreed to hep drive as only I had a car licence,the entire duration of the rental was dedicated to moving her things and I had little to no time to use it to move my own personal belongings as it too was already due to be returned. On top of that after I returned from dropping the cab back to its owner, my sister and my dad began rushing me out of the house so that they could return the house and not have to pay any fines to the landlord on account of me. So, I just packed up and went out with no solid plan yet and no way to access my financial or work apps to access any funds. (Pay lah, grab driver acc) to book my Airbnb. My bike wires i still haven’t had time to fix and I basically have no where to go with no real long term accommodation for myself. So with a mixture orf approx 20 bags and boxes, a guitar and a non-functional ebike, I have no idea where to go. Since we moved out of Pasir Ris grove my best plan is to go chill by the beach at Pasir Ris park. Hope to see a silver lining soon.",

My girlfriend game to fetch me from IMH and sign off on my discharge. Since getting news of my admission, my parentss have now turned full tilt on their support and say that I have to get a M- F 9 -5 job here and stay out of the house during those hours. My desire to go pursue my acting dreams in LA seems out of the question to them suddenly. This was not what the private psychiatrist we have been consulting with told them during our last appointment - his (Dr Calvin Fones') instructions to my parents was to leave me to my own devices and he only gave them permission to remind me to take my medicine (Valdoxan - which I have been taking diligently every night at 11pm). Given my parents have all but withdrawn their support for me now, and are not even giving me money any longer, I don't deem it fit to stay in this house any longer, as I am worried for my own health and safety under their roof.",

I’m in urgent need of a place to stay and I’m so sorry for simply asking like that but I have no other option. I’m scared and unsure of what to do. My home is an extremely toxic and controlling environment. I’ve been struggling to fight for my freedom my whole life. I was in jc for a year and dropped out as I couldn’t cope. I managed to secure a spot at Temasek poly law and management course. I’m currently interning at a law firm. My savings are around 2k plus and my Edusave money which I found out can be used to cover sch fees is arnd 2k plus as well. This was my last option, no girl would want to leave her family but I simply cannot handle it anymore. The abuse has been present since young. The physical abuse stopped at 15 but the emotional and psychological abuse had only doubled ever since then. I have cps and Social workers in my life but all the shelters are full.\r\nPpl simply say to mend things at home or handle it but I cannot. I’m exhausted from doing this my whole life I’ve been pushed to such a corner and I simply cannot go any further in the same household. I have rules and punishments for the most minute of things and all of this is driving me further into my feelings of hopelessness not to mention the way I’m treated at home which has left me feeling completely worthless as well. My parents have their reasons for being this way and it was partly my mistake as well. However I feel that this is enough and I simply need help. It would mean so much if I could have a temporary shelter. I’m unable to pay rent at the moment but I’m very good with household chores so I can help in any way required. Tysm for ur time and consideration.",

I got admitted on the 31st of March and was deemed fit by the doctors this morning for a minor wound I sustained on the 31st of March. I have been going through some setbacks in my life since 2016 after my divorce. I was diagnosed with mild depression but am off medication at the moment cause it's not affecting me anymore. \r\nI had depression 3 months prior as such was giving a doctor's note that I am unfit to work. But moving forward I will be seeking work and going back to being employed. But my challenges are my limited financial resources and thus accommodation. Just starting work my financies will not suffice for a open market rental. As such I am seeking a shelter. Together with my divorce in 2016,  the lost of job during covid, and medical problems I was not able to manage my setbacks well. I was a profession, with tertiary education but somehow these credential dont help. I have been to IMH for treatment and involved in their BRIDGE and AA programs. These programs will be for 90 days till June. As such jobs cant be full time with overtime so as to not miss my therapy. A part time job would not be sufficient to pay my rent in the open market. As such I need to stay in a cost effective accommodation as I continue with my recovery. I was on the verge of getting a 1 bedroom hdb rental unit with 1 another individual but he pulled out of medical reason. I have applied again with an appeal. On top of that my 2-room flexi was rejected last Oct due to the long queue cause by covid. So presently I have very limited option. \r\nMy illness is curable, I have just need to have medical and therapy needs as first priority and my work will be second for the next 3 months as advised by the psychiatrist. I have yet a get a place and would truely appreciate your assistance. I need something temporary as I stabilise with therapy, work and eventual rental or purchases of a hdb flat. As such I am seeking a shelter-night only is fine.\r\nYour advice or recommendation will be much appreciated. Many thanks.\r\n\r\nBlessings\r\nAndrew James\r\nCell: 91630380",

HDB was unresponsive for over 6 months. Multiple appeals sent in by MP, still pending answer.",

Ended up in Japan Osaka. But my marriage in Japan is coming to and end. Two yrs ago I start having problems walking and diagnosed hip bone problem.  Currently a handicap. Apparently I am being treated as a \"liability and burden\" to my in-laws here in Japan. \r\n\r\nLong story short. To save the embarrassment and stress for all parties I decided to leave. But where to?\r\n\r\nI don't have any property in Singapore. \r\n\r\nI grew up in Singapore with grandparents not knowing who were my real parents. Since after NS I have been working and traveling overseas. Did lots of works with NGOs and Christian mission organizations. But now I am heading towards being alone.\r\n\r\nI don't blame anyone. I already past 50s and crippled. \r\n\r\nI wish to go aside and live alone by myself, passing the rest of my days in peace and quietness.\r\n\r\nI know its difficult for people to understand that Japanese are polite people how can this happen? Japanese culture of obligations is difficult to understand. There are many homeless in Japan not because they cannot get help but there is the culture pressure to \"do things by yourself and take care of yourself\". That's why many Japanese live and die alone!\r\n\r\nI am looking at the options of someone helping me secure a place to stay back in Singapore. Perhaps a 2 room HDB rental? or if someone is willing to open their home extra room? I have a bit of saving and can pay little rent myself.\r\n\r\nI am currently writing Christian blog for outreach, so I need a place good wifi so I can continue working for the Lord before I die.\r\n\r\nMy online work can be found here - \r\n\r\nhttps://jowoyeshu.com/author/paulacts1126/\r\n\r\nI know asking for help may take time and I am preparing ahead.\r\n\r\nSo, if anyone willing to listen and looking into my situation. I be thankful.\r\n\r\nAll praise to Jesus\r\n\r\nI have no regrets no burdens. My hope for tomorrow is to live in peace and quietness and await my redemption in Christ.\r\n\r\nDavid Z\r\n\r\nEcclesiastes 12:13 - The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man\r\n",

Her relapses 4-5 years back was perhaps 1-2 times a year. Now it’s every month and recently….my mum had a relapse and is in maniac state, she wants to divorce my dad, disown me, kicked me out of the house and throw everything out of the window. This was about 2 days ago when an argument happened. This is the worst in all these years. Yesterday I sneaked back home to see how things are and if I could reconcile and stay… my mum quickly wanted to kick me out and my dad tried to calm her down but she insisted I no longer be in the house. She started getting hysterical and insulted my dad and me and just threatened to suicide and all if I didn’t leave. I called the police and the police came and assessed that they wanted to bring her to imh for assessment. She was not cooperative and threatened to the police to “see what happens/she will jump tonight” if they dare bring her. Anyws they brought her and she end up wasn’t warded cos my dad refuses to let her. My dad has been passive since young and even if my mum slaps or insults he’ll take it in. So yea after she came out, she took the passport and left for Bali, my dad just followed. As much as I’m worried about her safety and finances(mums p much not working, dads a grab driver), I’m also worried what will happen when she comes back to see me home on Friday(supposed return flight 4aug). I’m now staying at home since my parents are overseas till Friday. I’ve been paying my own bills since army and currently I’m exploring accommodation options but it seems that open rental market is unaffordable for me. We don’t have good ties with relatives and my friends could tide me over for atmost a few days. Is there any way I could seek help for it",

So they began showing anger/aggression through mental, physical and verbal abuse over the course of a month. It got so bad that I called the police twice but they couldn't help much as it was considered a family matter. I've tried reaching out to social services as well but they are taking quite a while to find me a shelter home and also told me not to get my hopes up. I have been staying with my friend for the past 10 days (I got kicked out on 27 November). But they will be travelling soon and so I need to find another place to stay asap. \r\n\r\nI've managed to find a rental room but the earliest move-in date is 3 Jan 2023 as there is still a tenant living there. Therefore, I only need a place of shelter from now till 3 Jan. I hope I get lucky and can receive help as I am trying my very hardest to keep going and not give up or break down. \r\n",

I can only rely on my sales proceeds to survive my old age while I continue to work. \r\n\r\nBut come end September 2023, I gonna be faced with a critical issue - Accommodation, a problem which weighs heavily on me. Ive watched the documentary \"Homeless\" wherein I understand professionals like you offer help to the homeless. I forsee myself to be homeless after I vacate my flat to the new owner on 5th October 2023.\r\n\r\nThe rental in the open market is way exorbitant. The best option I could seek is to apply for a  public flat through the Joint Single Public Rental Scheme. I can stay in a temporary shelter while awaiting for a public flat. I so needed a roof over me ...\r\n\r\nI earnestly seek your help in whatever way you deem possible. I can be reached at 8044 6308 but do drop me a message if Im not able to answer your call while at work. I can come down to your office if need be.",

I arrived in Singapore during the beginning of  June 2022, after Elite Asia Company (Singapore) promised me that they are able to offer a salary of 4000 SGD and a pass. After one month of my arrival in Singapore, I had to give them a buzz for going quiet, and they said that they cannot offer this job to me. \r\n\r\nWhile I was in India from January to May 2022, I worked virtually from March to May 2022 (contract based). All the money that I have spent risking Singapore's job here, I ended up being in vain. Since I am already in Singapore, I have put some effort into securing jobs in Singapore, but nothing has succeeded. \r\n\r\nSince my visa is coming to an end (October 28) and I can barely survive here in Singapore, I seriously need to exit Singapore and never want to return back without any official letter as a proof. Could you please buy an air ticket to return back to India? And, I can barely get to eat due to lack of money. \r\n\r\nPlease note that I have no mobile phone -- the motherboard has collapsed from the past 3 months. We can have a virtual chat or a call on facebook messenger or Zoom or Google Meet. And, I really want to take all of my leftover things which was kept at my friend's place for over 6 months along with me, as I do not want to return back here at any cost. \r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you soon. \r\n\r\n\r\nBest wishes, \r\nPrem Singh Gill",

As it's a 12-hour shift, she only works for 3-4 days per week and she needs a place to shelter her on her rest days. (Most shelters we seek do not allow people to stay in the shelter outside of sleeping hours, and she really doesn't have a place to go on free days.)\r\n\r\nMy current workplace is generally quite accessible, but I will be jobless soon and I don't know what my new job would be like - if I actually manage to get a new job, that is. As for the university I'm applying, it's quite far (Clementi area) and it requires me to transfer from MRT to bus in order to reach the place. Class schedule is evening, usually from 6 or 7pm till 10pm.\r\n\r\nWe need a place that does not restrict us on timing given our crazy and tight schedules - such as allowing us to leave and return, or stay within the premise freely. Otherwise we won't be able to return on time and even perform basic necessities like showering and washing clothes because we can only come back really late at night, and most shelters we've asked have a strict curfew starting around 10-11pm.",

She is uncertain if she can still keep her job or she'd be retrenched anytime.\r\nI work as a temp staff and my contract will end this coming June.\r\nThere is a high chance we'll both be jobless sooner or later due to uncertainly of work arrangements and high retrenchment rate/lesser job opportunities in the workforce this year.\r\n\r\n(2) Money from sale of flat is not enough for us to buy a place to live from open market. Prices are extremely high in the market still and they are generally unafforable to us.\r\nMy mother is unable to obtain housing loan due to her old age (she's 65 this year). This means the only way she can buy a flat is to pay the amount in full cash.\r\nShe has no savings because most of that was already spent on the divorce case (lawyer fees and such).\r\nI have no savings also because I had to fork out mine to pay for daily expenses for both myself and my mother. I intend to continue my studies but I'd be forced to quit because I won't be able to pay for my school fees and expenses.\r\n\r\nTried to look for rental via open market. Most prices are ridiculously costly and they come with very restricted conditions that can actually push our expenses even higher than necessary.\r\nWe were almost scammed by some landlords numerous times, and this has already made us very paranoid towards renting from open market.\r\n\r\nTried to seek help through MP and Social Workers.

    "reasons-for-homelessness": "Parents divorced. As per court order, flat had to be sold within 6 months. Ex-husband threatened to take matters to court if my mother failed to make effort to start the resale flat procedure within 6 months from date of court order. My mother was forced to comply even though we were unable to find a place to stay once the flat sale is completed.\r\n\r\nDuring sale of flat, ex-husband and buyers refused extension to give my mother more time to find a new place to stay. We were chased out of the flat immediately upon sales completion. Buyers (new flat owners) also threatened us when we were trying to gather our belongings before handing over the keys.\r\n\r\nCurrently both my mother and I are homeless.",

Our house is undergoing renovation works which started on Monday, 3 April. \r\nPrior to this, a month ago, my husband and I spoke and asked my mother if it was fine that we stayed with her while our house gets renovated. We were told that we were welcomed and that she would speak to her tenant (she rented out one of her rooms). Every week we would ask and remind her, she mentioned that it was ok and we were under the impression that there were no issues and that it is confirmed. We were supposed to move in last Friday, 31 March. On that day, while we were packing, she suddenly came over, we wondered why because we were already seeing her later when we move in but brushed it off and carried on packing. As we were finishing, we suddenly told us only there and then, that her tenant is not comfortable and do not want children in the house. She continued to tell us that she didn’t want to further the conversation or sour the relationship with her. \r\nThat just left us speechless and our minds spiralling. We really cannot afford to rent outside and have been spending way more than we should, depleting our savings and touching the funds that took us years to raise, for essential and minimal furnitures like beds for our children to sleep once our home is ready. \r\nThe renovation is not something we could have done the moment we got our house typically like new homeowners, we had to clean the house and make do with the existing state. We had to save up just for important furnitures and the renovation is funded by taking up a loan. \r\nWe are putting up at a hostel in Dunlop Street, Jalan Besar until this Saturday, we are in hopes to secure a temporary place to stay or at least a comfortable and safe place for our children to sleep for approximately 2 months.",
