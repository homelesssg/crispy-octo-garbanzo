Since then we raise 700rm for him in 1 day, bought him food and supplies that should last him for the next 3-4 weeks. however because MCO will be ending soon, that means he will have to return to SG. he used to worked in SG as a security guard but because of MCO/CB he was stuck and cant work, thats the main reason why his money ran out. He mentioned that he have no family, no house in Singapore and after serving the mandatory SHN, he will have no accomodations because he has been living in Jb for quite some time already. With the borders remaining closed and god knows for how long, Uncle John is gonna be homeless in SG for sure.",

Pt’s was recently admitted to IMH in late September following an impulsive episode of self-injurious attempt, precipitated by a multitude of stressors ranging from financial to accommodation woes, and a sense of rejection and emotional isolation arising from unsatisfactory interactions with friends and family members. This is further perpetuated by a reduced capacity of effective emotional regulation, a lack of stable accommodation, an assessed lack of socio-emotional support in the community, and maladaptive ways of coping such as turning to epam and alcohol—which exacerbates his risk of harm to self.\r\n \r\nCurrently, pt’s mental and emotional state is observed to be more settled and he no longer endorses active suicide ideation. Pt expresses hopes of breaking out of the cycle of repeated admissions and imprisonment, and to reduce his dependence on alcohol and epam. He is also amenable to follow up with NAMS post discharge, to be equipped with more adaptive ways of coping. While there remains a degree of volatility in his emotional state in view of anticipated triggers post discharge e.g. unsatisfactory interactions with friends, we hope that a closer collaboration among systems like FSC, IMH, SSO, HDB and MSF, would be able to help pt feel more supported in his recovery journey.\r\n \r\nAccommodation assistance at this juncture is thus crucial in providing pt with some form of stability in his life, and empower him to redirect his energies towards other areas e.g. to secure gainful employment, permanent housing and to facilitate pt’s progress towards achieving a more sustainable emotional and mental health status.",

It is unclear how Mr Nagoor has been showering and washing his clothes since. Mr Nagoor is afraid to visit mother again especially as mother has a PPO filed against him since 6-7 years ago and mother may call the police on him if he visits. Mr Nagoor keeps his items at one of his friend's place and carries the rest of his items in his bag. It has been about a month since he sleeps at the street of the condo he works at as security",

Since then Samantha has been staying with different friends/ acquaintances for the past few years and sustained herself through odd jobs though she was also exposed to moral danger and became vulnerable to financial exploitation during these years where she did not have a fixed accommodation.  \r\n\r\nSamantha was then presented to IMH recently due to suicide and self-harm concerns as she was deeply affected by a traumatic episode with a friend. She has since tried to return home in her last discharge and stayed with her adoptive parents but the arrangement was unsustainable due to her bad experience and poor perception of parents. She was admitted to IMH once again last month as she felt suicidal again while trying to manage the pressure from staying with parents. We are concerned that Samantha will remain homeless once more after this discharge and become vulnerable towards abuse and exploitation by strangers or others acquaintances with ill intent, which will then aggravate her poor mood and emotional regulation.",

As he has been living at a hotel provided by his company, he may be asked to leave tonight. AS his family is living in Malaysia, he is unable to go back he hopes to search for another job in Singapore. As he has limited savings ($50) left and he is not able to receive his salary until the end of the month, he is unable to explore other options like hostel. He is also unable to stay with his family members in Singapore as they have their own family commitments and unable to prove accommodation for him. As such, I would like to request for interim accommodation while he searches for another job/accommodation and apply for HDB rental flat. Thank you!",

While he has already attempted to seek financial and accommodation support from them, they have rejected to do so. Client reports not having any other social support to turn to when he needs help.\r\n\r\nClient has agreed to temporarily stay in a hostel, which charges him $20/night.

Clt is receiving FA Nov 2020 to Feb 2021. \r\n\r\nSocial\r\nClient's NRIC address is his friend's home, and reported that he has friends who have offered to let him stay in their homes, but client declined.\r\n\r\nHDB\r\nClient reported that he has been to HDB many times and was offered a rental flat a few years ago in Punggol/Sengkang, but client did not want to take it up as he prefers for a flat in BukitBatok/Jurong East. \r\n\r\nHealth\r\nClt reported no health issues. \r\n\r\nFamily\r\nClt (M59) said he was married in 1992 and separated/divorced in Y2001 when their only dg was then 9y.o. Clt is estranged from his dg (F25) and said she is divorced and has 2 daughters (F5, F3). Clt said he does not know where his daughter and granddaughters are and misses his granddaughters (F5, F3) whom he has not seen for more than a year. Clt’s daughter (F25) has an open case with South Central Community FSC and is their primary client.\r\n\r\nClt’s FOO\r\nClt shared that both his parents have passed on and that his late mom last lived at Blk 235 Bukit Batok. Clt said he is the 4th child in his FOO and has 11 siblings (some have passed on). Clt said he is close to 2 younger brothers, one in prison currently (whom he visits at Changi Prison) and another younger brother who lives at Bedok and works at a food stall. \r\n\r\nIncarcerated brother's rental flat\r\nClt said he goes to his (incarcerated) younger brother’s rental flat once a week to change clothes and keep his personal belongings. Clt does not want to stay in his incarcerated brother's current rental flat and seemed to be unable to get along with the current malay co-applicant but did not want to elaborate when asked.  \r\n\r\nHousing\r\nClt said he had sold his HDB flat (5/4 room) after business failure. Clt mentioned he used to have business stalls at a Bukit Batok coffee shop.   \r\n\r\nEmotion / Cognition\r\nClt (M59) said he does not want to talk about his past and misses his 2 granddaughters (F5, F3). Clt said he has the will power and wants to focus on getting his own BTO flat. Clt said not to contact him meantime as he is using a phone top up card. Clt said he will speak to the police if approached and will give his IC.   \r\n\r\nEmployment status\r\n18 Dec 2020 - Clt reported that he had just started a new job (less than a mth) as a cleaner at Blk 400+ Bukit Batok, a new shopping mall with NTUC supermarket inside (presumably LeQuest). Client said he is anticipating getting his 1st mth’s payslip to show HDB when he goes there to apply for a BTO flat. Clt reported having enough CPF to apply for BTO and needs to show HDB he has stable income. \r\n\r\nUpdate: Clt mentioned in Feb 2021 that he had lost his cleaning job and was given short notice to leave. Clt's emotion was dysregulated and abruptly cut off the line. \r\n\r\nRental flat\r\nClt said he had been offered rental flat at Punggol/Sengkang but he does not want to take the offer as the Bukit Batok neighbourhood where he is now is like a kampung to him and many people knows him. Clt mentioned he also does not want to live with another co-applicant but have his own flat.",

He stayed with a certain organization for about a month and was asked to leave on 17th Feb.

As we are renting the current place that we are staying, we found out that strictly speaking, we cannot let someone that is not family to stay with us (HDB regulation on people renting HDB apartment from the owner).

He can't stand my father anymore, as he keep stealing his money, he don't have him to do housework, he doesn't bath properly, as my uncle say he have body odour, he doesn't change his bedsheet, he doesn't wash his own clothes, he doesn't wash his hands and legs when he came back from home and my father always act like a king at my uncle place, which my uncle cannot stand him anymore and keep bugging me whether HDB get back to me already because my uncle really stand him due to his laziness never help to clean at his house, cleanliness issue doesn't want to find job and work, keep asking for money and steal money from his wallet every night when he sleep. My uncle have give me that dateline that my father my to shift out by end of this month. Thus if by then he have no space to stay and he have to stay on the road side. Then I will suffer and my father will keep bugging me and I will go crazy.\r\n\r\nMy father is getting bad to worse, when since my mum passed away on the 18 Dec 2017. Because no one can control him expect my mum. \r\nHe doesn't want to work since Jan 2018 and keep asking me for money, I give him $400 every month, he have cpf for life $305 every month and silver support every 3 month $540 which I believe is enough for him to spend as he doesn't need to pay anything every month, his hp billed I pay for him and he don't need to pay rent to my uncle, but he have a bad habits, he like to drinks, whenever he have money he will go n drinks with his fren and spend all his money finished in 1 day, he is a person that how much he have he will spend finished in 1 day, he don't care about tomorrow he got money to eat or not, he then will keep calling me to ask me for money, everytime he call me is to ask for money and not call me to ask me how am I? I feel that I don't have a father as he doesn't treat me as his daughter, he treat me as a ATM which make me very sad.\r\n\r\nMy father issues is leading me to have depression, I keep crying everyday, I can't sleep and also can't concentrate on my work. I keep thinking what have I done wrong and why I have this type of father. I am the only child and there no one that can help me and I have no one to look for when I need help. Thus, I look for social worker and MP for help to write to HDB. However HDB have rejected my application of rental that staying long.",

Client has been living with her ex-fiance's family since June 2019 but has decided to leave her ex-fiance and the family home in view of the conflictual relationship with her ex-fiance's mother who would hurl hurtful words at her. Client had reportedly been tolerating the behaviour of her ex-fiance's mother over the years, but a recent incident where she was hit by her ex-fiance’s mother for no reason precipitated her decision to leave the home. The recent argument also resulted in client loosing focus at work which led to her leaving her previous employment. Client is estranged from her two daughters from her first marriage and has no other informal social support she can turn to, as such client has been rough sleeping in Redhill since Monday (3 May 2021). As such, client hopes to receive help in terms of temporary shelter so that she will be able to achieve some stability to find her next employment.",

They are presently homeless and have been sleeping in Mdm Rosneta's company car since November 2021. \r\n\r\nHousing history:\r\n Mdm Rosneta and Alfyan were previously renting a room (open market rental) however had to shift out in November 2021 as they had financial difficulties to continue paying the rental fee. Mdm Rosneta have approached HDB in December 2021 to apply for a public rental flat.\r\n\r\nFamily and financial background:\r\nMdm Rosneta's divorce was completed in July 2021 due to the longstanding history of spousal violence. Being the sole breadwinner, Mdm Rosneta experienced huge financial stressors when she and her son had to undergo an operation in November and September 2021 respectively. While Mdm Rosneta holds about 3 part-time jobs as a parcel and food delivery rider currently, the bulk of her pay goes to pay off her huge debts (about $18,000) to licensed moneylenders that was incurred as a result of the conflictual marital relationship in the past. Mdm Rosneta and Alfyan are primarily reliant on ex-husband's maintenance fee of $250/month to meet their basic needs. \r\n\r\nMdm Rosneta's emotional wellbeing and coping:\r\nMdm Rosneta disclosed that she had past suicidal ideations and self-harm attempts. The last incident occurred in November 2021 and was triggered by multiple stressors (i.e. unstable housing, financial stressors, and her antagonistic relationship with her family of origin). She identified her responsibility as a mother and concerns for Alfyan as her protective factors. \r\n\r\nAssessment and Recommendation:\r\nThe current living arrangement for Mdm Rosneta and Alfyan to continue sleeping in the car is assessed to be unsafe due to the risk factors of Alfyan being a minor and Mdm Rosneta being a female. HCSA Dayspring is presently in the midst of putting up a referral for the family to reside in a Transitional Shelter, while working towards the longer-term plans of advocating for a public rental flat from HDB. \r\n\r\nWe hope to collaborate with Homeless Hearts of Singapore to explore alternative short-term living arrangements that Mdm Rosneta and Alfyan can reside in. This will greatly help to provide a safe and stable environment for their physical and psychological safety, while Sengkang FSC and HCSA Dayspring continue to work with the family on their shelter application.",

I'm in conversation with one of the elderly shelter homes as well on the above.\r\n\r\nI've also explored with family on how they can support. The relative/extended family has tried to support him monetarily on an adhoc basis. Currently his niece is paying for his hostel/hotel stay in the interim but they acknowledge that they are at wits end as the paying can ramp up quickly. Niece's family is unable to house him as they have a complete family and their home is not conducive for an elderly his age (no rooms/space). Client did stay with his sister (niece's mum) for about 2 months (Sep and Oct) before being asked to leave as well as they found it hard to manage with him around (space issues). Family's consensus was that while they might not be able to house him, they continue to try and support him in monetary support in manageable amounts.",

He and his ex-wife divorced and he gave up his shares of the flat to his ex-wife.\r\nAs such, he became homeless. For the first week of January 2023, he got into a minor accident \r\nand was hospitalised. Following his discharge from the hospital, he stayed the S3P shelter for \r\nabout 1 week before he moved out to stay in a hostel (Wink @ McCallum Street) due to the \r\nserious bed bugs infestation at the S3P shelter. He is unable to stay for long at the hostel due to his limited savings and limited income from his current part-time work. \r\n\r\nIn February 2023, FSC helped to (a) provide some adhoc cash to help him to extend his stay at the hostel for 1 week while liaising with a transitional shelter for him to get temporary accommodation.  We went for the intake interview but was rejected in the end last week as the transitional shelter requested for a medical memo to state that he was fit for communal living but the hospital shared that they do not provide such discharge memos. His case manager has helped to share with shelter that generally there are no significant concerns about it but it is still insufficient without the medical document. (c) Liaised with One Singapore who helped to extend his stay at the current hostel for another week till 26 Feb 2023.\r\n\r\nMr Wong had limited familial support and is largely on his own. He has experiences of being a victim of family violence so its difficult for him to reconcile with his family and he has no friends that can help him.",

During their marriage, Ms Ngyuen reported that her spouse has threatened her multiple times that should she do anything against his wishes (e.g., applying for permanent resident) he would terminate her LTVP. This has led to Ms Ngyuen living in fear of being expatriated back to Vietnam and more importantly, lose her rights and access to her daughter. Ms Ngyuen also reported that she has been subjected to years of psychological abuse by her spouse and his family.\r\nIn early June, Ms Ngyuen was chased out of the family home and has been living in her workplace since. However, this is a short-term solution, and she will not be able to continue living there for too long as her employer is only allowing her to do so on compassionate grounds.\r\nMs Ngyuen has limited social support in Singapore as her family members are all residing in Vietnam while her friends in Singapore are only primarily able to provide her with emotional support.\r\nWith the experienced power struggle in a transnational relationship, limited social support, and financial resources, it has caused Ms Ngyuen to experience great distress in managing her presenting challenges. This is further exacerbated through the lack of stable accommodation and lacking awareness on navigating Singapore’s systems. During FSC’s interactions with Ms Ngyuen, it is assessed that due to the lack of accommodation, Ms Ngyuen has difficulties focusing on her future plans.\r\nDue to her unique circumstance, Ms Ngyuen is not eligible for any interim housing support and as such can only consider open market rental. However, due to her job, she is only able to pay $300 per month for the rental market. She has also been rejected by the applications to crisis shelter due to the lack of recurrence of violence currently.",

    "reasons-for-homelessness": "Sumathi is a 58 year-old female. She is currently living with her 62-year old brother, Vijay and 83-year old mother, Minambal in a hostel - Asphodel Inn. \r\n\r\n1) Accommodation issue\r\n- Sumathi, Vijay, and mother has been staying at Asphodel Inn for the past 7 months ($85/day). \r\n- The three of them lived in a 4-room HDB Rental flat in Dorset Road. \r\n- In November 2021, their lease ended and the landlord sold the flat. Therefore, they decided to rent a room at Asphodel Inn temporarily. \r\n- Till date, they were not able to rent from the open market due to their limited financial capacity as both Vijay and Sumathi are unemployed. They will be evicted from Asphodel Inn tomorrow (30/06/2022)  as they have accumulated a substantial amount of outstanding fees ($425).\r\n\r\n2) Family's Formal Resources/Support\r\n- Kampong Kapor FSC (KKFSC) will be applying for emergency cash support of $300 for them. However, it will likely only sustain them for a few days.\r\n- KKFSC is liaising with SSO to process their Short-term Comcare Financial Assistance. However, the process might require another 3 weeks or so.\r\n\r\n3) Family's Informal Resources\r\n- Their two other brothers, Sugumaran and Ramanathan lives together in a 3-room purchased flat in Pandan Gardens. \r\n- On top of having a strained relationship with Vijay, the two have rented out one of their rooms, so they are unable to accommodate Sumathi's group. \r\n- The two provides financial support for their mother every month ($400-$500). However, it is barely sufficient to meet their various needs (daily essentials, hostel fee, medical fees).\r\n\r\n4) Medical\r\n- Sumathi has high blood pressure and is on medication. She is not able to work due to caregiving responsibilities for mother.\r\n- Vijay had stroke in 2014 but can walk slowly requiring walking aid at times. \r\n- Vijay also has other chronic illnesses and is on medication.\r\n- Minambal is wheelchair bound. Her health is deteriorating due to old age. \r\n\r\n5) Working Goals\r\n- The family informed social worker that they are expecting a sum of money to be remitted from their friend in India on 10 July 2022 as a loan\r\n- They are expecting to receive about $1,000-$2,000 (once a month for a few months) and hopes to receive support for their accommodation needs until then.\r\n- KKFSC is currently exploring with family on Transitional Shelter as an interim accommodation option\r\n- In terms of long-term goals, the family hopes to secure either an open-market rental or 2-room Flexi HDB \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n- As such, we hope to request for HHOS's kind assistance to support the family in terms of their accommodation needs at least until they receive the financial support from their friend in India and when their Comcare assistance is approved. As the current hostel they are staying has an attached bathroom and they have their personal room, it is more ideal for the physical needs of the mother due to her mobility issues and need for caregiver.",

She would also get angry with him if he attempted to clear some of the items.\r\n\r\nDilton shared that he has been staying with friends. He is currently staying with a friend in Woodlands but his friend has requested for him to leave by 10/3/22. He has made arrangements to stay with another friend, but will only be able to move in a month. Dilton reported having exhausted his resources and is unable to approach any friends or family for temporary shelter. \r\n\r\nAs Dilton is a student, he is only able to work part-time and earns $300-400 monthly. He is unable to afford renting from the open market as his income is needed for daily expenses. He also has limited support and has no contact with his biological father since he was 6 years old.\r\n\r\nGiven the above challenges faced by Dilton, he is assessed to be at risk of being homeless.",

Landlord made her write a note and force her to move out by 21 March as he has accepted another tenant's deposit.\r\nExplored taking actions for the unreasonable requests made by her landlord. Client is fearful to act against landlord due to landlord’s threat in throwing away her items if she makes a police report or finds someone to talk to him. Due to client’s reliance on his accommodation and client's age, client dared not offend the landlord.",

She had been staying at Phuket for the past 8 years with her youngest son and only returned to Singapore on 6 October 2021 to reunite with her children. Youngest son however, returned 2 years earlier than client and had been looked after by client’s father. \r\n\r\nHer first two children were from her first marriage. They were under the custody of her ex-husband but due to their strained relationship with their biological father, both of them left home at different juncture. Her youngest child is from her relationship with Mr Hadi who passed away in 2021. Youngest child has been diagnosed with mild autism by the professional in Phuket but client doesn't have a copy of the report. Client married with Mr James, an American national in 2015, and had lived in Phuket with him. However, they separated in 2016 and has not been in contact. Last known location of Mr James is in US. \r\n\r\nSince her return, client has hope to reconcile with her children and to stay together as a family. She applied for a rental flat but is pending for an outcome of their application from HDB. Hence, the family has been moving places to places for the past few months. Initially, she brought along her daughter, Aisha to join Adam and their paternal grandfather who were staying with client's elder sister, Jaime. However, this had further aggravated the relationship between client and Jaime. Jaime had been unhappy eversince their father and Adam lodged at her house. Jaime was adamant to have client and the rest out of her flat as she didn’t have the privacy that she wanted with her daughter. \r\n\r\nCurrently, client and her family has been lodging at a temporary place at Pasir Ris Street 13 since January 2022 with the help of a religious teacher but had been told that they need to vacate the place by Monday, 14 March 2022. The owner, who is the religious teacher's  niece has plan to renovate and sell off the flat, thus client has to leave on the stipulated date. \r\n\r\nHence, client had tried asking her two sisters, Jaime and Jessica again to accommodate the family from 14 March onwards but both of them declined to offer help. As Jessica and her husband stays in the studio flat owned by their father, Mr Arvinder, she cited that there is lack of space for everyone to stay in the flat. \r\n\r\nClient has not been working  after returning back to Singapore and relies on the SSO financial assistance of $1190 cash to support her family expenses. The assistance is from January 2022 to March 2022. Client has plan to work but is overwhelmed with the unstable accommodation. At the moment, she does not have any savings. ",

Her head has been swollen till now and she is still suffering from pain in her head. On 15 Oct, her husband also verbally abused her and threatened her that he will keep their 13 month old baby should she leave. In previous incidents of violence, her husband will also hit her head and legs, pull her hair, tried to strangle her till she almost could not breathe. He is also verbally abusive towards her and says degrading things to her, disturbs the baby's sleep, and intentionally remove the baby from Mushfika when he is latching.\r\n\r\nHer husband drinks almost everyday since July 2022 and tends to drink more on Friday - Saturdays when he is not working. Hence Mushfika is worried about hers and her baby's safety coming this weekend.",

The 3 of them are Indian citizens. Mdm Lakshmi is married to a Singaporean PR who returned to India on 12.12.2022 after an incident on 04.12.2022 where he turned violent on her. We are not sure if he intends to return to Singapore. Mdm Lakshmi is currently staying with her 2 children in a shelter managed by Transition Plus. Mdm Lakshmi's husband was also staying with the family but was evicted after the incident of violence. \r\n\r\nAccommodation matters\r\nMdm Lakshmi and her husband were issued with a Letter of Notification - Mandated discharge by the shelter on 21.11.2022 due the multiple breaches including non-compliance with medication by the husband for his mental health condition, physical and verbal abuse, breaking of agreement with shelter by bringing in unauthorized family members (client's 2 sons from India) into the shelter on 17.10.2022. The deadline for client to move out of the shelter was on 16.01.2023. However, the shelter extended the deadline to 30.01.2023 and is unable to extend it further. Currently c,lient and her 2 children are still in the unit managed by the shelter although they are not allowed to be there.\r\n\r\nRequest\r\nWe wonder if your kind organization has any accommodation resources for the family. The FSC's referrals to other shelters have also been rejected. Hence, we are reaching out to Homeless Hearts.

While FSC is assisting Haslam in applying for transition shelter, he will benefit from having a temporary hostel to live in comfortably.\r\n\r\nPoor family relationship:\r\n- Haslam has been estranged from his parents since he was about 16 years old due to him stealing money from them. He was recently estranged from his grandmother, whom he was previously sharing a rental flat with after years of conflictual relationship. FSC tried to contact grandmother to try to help them reconcile but grandmother was not keen on engaging.\r\n\r\nFinancial and employment issues:\r\n- Haslam has been facing financial difficulties since being estranged from his parents. He was forced to be independent early in life and had to make a living on his own because his grandmother is also unable to provide him with financial support. \r\n- Haslam's financial difficulties have increased after the birth of his son in Nov 2022. His 16-year-old girlfriend, who is the child's mother, is taking care of the child with her parents but Haslam hopes to save money to provide for the child's future. \r\n- Haslam had dropped out of ITE twice due to him prioritising work over education. After dropping out once, he was given a second chance and was re-admitted to school in 2021. His attendance continued to be poor and he dropped out again after half a year despite school and FSC support. \r\n- Haslam has been working odd jobs and working as a food delivery rider for the past year. He is currently working as a FoodPanda delivery rider. However, he shared that he has hopes of getting a more stable job so that he can provide for his child. ",

    "reasons-for-homelessness": "Mr Tok is a 67 years old widowed man. He is currently residing at Atlantis@531 hotel (531 Serangoon Road Singapore 218163).\r\n\r\n1) Family\r\nMr Tok got married in Philippines and his late wife passed away 10 years ago. He has a daughter, 26, a Filipino citizen who is working as an accountant in Philippines, earning around 12,000 pesos (SGD 280+). She does not send him money regularly.\r\n\r\nMr Tok's adoptive parents have passed away. He has no contact with his biological parents or siblings. The only person assisting him currently is his childhood friend Mr Chay, who lent him money for his current hostel stay. \r\n\r\n2) Housing\r\nClient lived in Philippines since 1960s and only moved back to Singapore in Jun 2022 to seek treatment for his eyes. Since Jun 2022, client has been staying at a private rental room in Jurong for $450/month. He was supposed to stay till Nov 22. However, there was no rental agreement between him and the landlord. Therefore, he has no black/white to prove the agreement. The landlord and his roommate then indirectly accused Mr Tok of stealing. Additionally, Mr Tok lost his handphone at home and made a police report.\r\n\r\nDue to several disagreements, Mr Tok eventually moved out on 13 Aug 22 and stayed at a hotel (Fragrance hotel @ Balestier Rd). He stayed there from 13 to 23 Aug 22 and subsequently moved to Altantis@531 Hostel. He exhausted his finances for the stay at Fragrance hotel and, thus Mr Chay offered to provide temporary financial support for a short-term stay at the hostel until 2 Sept 22. Mr Chay expressed difficulty in supporting him past that day.\r\n\r\n3) Health \r\nMr Tok has cataract on both eyes and already operated on his left eye. He would be going for an assessment for his right eye on 1 Sep and would likely be referred to undergo the operation to remove his cataract soon after. His right eye has almost no vision due to the cataract.\r\n\r\nHe experiences some pain when climbing stairs and would not be able to climb long flights of stairs. He also faces occasional back pain.\r\n\r\n4) Finances\r\nHe is receiving CPF RSS payout during his last application with SSO, therefore did not qualify for Comcare financial assistance. He is currently unemployed and intends to seek employment after his cataract operation.\r\n\r\nWe would appreciate if HHOS could support him financially to stay at the hostel until SSO@Jalan Besar & KKFSC are able to admit him into a S3P or TS. We would recommend to extend his stay for another 7 days for now.\r\n\r\nWe hope you can consider his application and we hope to hear from you soon, thank you very much!",

AMKFSC Transition Plus will not be able to further extend the shelter stay for Mr Ariff.\r\nMr Ariff has made attempts with regards to securing a flat for himself and his family. He has previously made an application for Open Booking of flats on 12 October 2022 but was not successful due to the leftover options of short lease 2 room Flexi flats for elderly.\r\nIn August 2022, Mr Ariff applied for a Build-To-Order (BTO) 2-room Flexi flat in Keat Hong Grange. He managed to secure a queue number and is waiting for HDB’s notice to select a flat in November 2022.\r\nMr Ariff has made a trip down to Malaysia JB on 27 October 2022, to explore the possibility of renting a flat for his family to reside, while he waits for his BTO selection of flat and a family shelter in Singapore. He managed to secure a 2-room flat in Malaysia JB as a temporary place for his wife and children to reside in, while he works with caseworker to explore alternate housing arrangement in Singapore.\r\nMr Ariff’s family has arrived at Singapore on 5 November 2022 and they stayed at Porcelain Hotel @ Chinatown from 5 to 8 November 2022.. The family had made their trip to Malaysia JB this afternoon but was denied entry to Malaysia due to the fact that Mr Ariff’s family members are non-Singaporean and they are not allowed to rent a house at Malaysia,. The family is at risk of being homelessness as Mr Ariff has spent most of his fund to place a deposit for the flat in Malaysia JB, the hotel stay at Chinatown and his daughter’s medical fee.\r\nMr Ariff's family is currently staying in K Hotel till tomorrow afternoon and will run out of funds to pay for the rest of their stay.

Mr Ariff’s wife and children might also face issues with the immigration due to their citizenship status. Mr Ariff intends to apply Singapore Citizenship for them but there has been no concrete plan thus far.\r\nAs Mr Ariff’s family is denied entry at the Malaysia JB custom and will not be able to stay in the flat that Mr Ariff has made a deposit in, considering Mr Ariff’s family’s well-being and the risk of homelessness, we would like to appeal for an urgent family shelter for Mr Ariff and his family.",

    "reasons-for-homelessness": "[Summary]:\r\nMdm Dorothy is a single individual who is in need of an urgent accommodation due to her present state of homelessness. Her housing instability seems to be perpetuated by her estranged relationship with her children, as evident in the fact that she is not on talking terms with Jesseca and that she shares a highly conflictual relationship with Michelle. At the same time, Mdm Dorothy lacks social support as she cites that none of her friends or relatives are able to support or accommodate her at present. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, Mdm Dorothy’s financial constraints as a result of lack of savings and present unemployment has further exacerbated her accommodation needs as she is unable to rent or purchase a flat from the open market with her inadequate financial resources.  \r\n\r\nMdm Dorothy’s current state of homelessness appears to have adversely impacted her emotional well-being and physical health, as observed in her anxiousness and physical presentation during the session at MWS Covenant Family Service Centre (CFSC). \r\n\r\nMdm Dorothy’s suicide and self-harm risk is presently assessed to be low as she does not have any active or concrete plans to kill or harm herself.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Mdm Dorothy has presented to be highly motivated to partner with CFSC on securing a permanent housing.  \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[More details]:\r\nMdm Dorothy is a divorcee who has three adult daughters from her first marriage. \r\n\r\nMdm Dorothy suffers from constant leg pain and diabetes. As a result of her diabetic condition, her 3rd, 4th, and 5th toe on her right foot have been amputated. While she does not require a walking stick or wheelchair, her condition has affected her mobility and ability to walk for long distance. At the same time, Mdm Dorothy was hospitalized in early 2023 due to heart issues and heart attack episodes. She has an upcoming heart bypass surgery on 17 March 2023. Mdm Dorothy is known to a Medical Social Worker at Sengkang General Hospital.\r\n\r\nMdm Dorothy used to work as an ad-hoc security guard in the past. Most recently, she resigned from\r\nher full-time employment as a security guard with an alarm systems company where accommodation was provided due to the deterioration of her health condition. She resigned in the last quarter of 2022 and served her notice till January 2023. Mdm Dorothy is presently unemployed, she intends to seek shelter support before looking for ad-hoc employments to support her financial needs. \r\n\r\nMdm Dorothy does not receive financial support from her daughters and/or any of her family or relatives. She currently relies on her limited savings of around $700 in her bank account for her daily needs. Following the sale of her flat in March 2022, Mdm Dorothy engaged JC Movers/Storage to store her furniture and appliances for $700 a month. Most recently, due to her financial constraints, she managed to sell most of her furniture and appliances to the company and had reduced her monthly storage fees to $150. Apart from the monthly storage fees, Mdm Dorothy is also required to make a monthly payment of $50 for her COURTS arrears.\r\n\r\nMdm Dorothy’s second daughter, Jesseca, works in a bank and is residing in a 5-room HDB flat at Potong Pasir with her husband and two children. Jesseca and her husband was reported to also share a strained relationship with Mdm Dorothy. At present, they are not on talking terms and Jesseca’s husband does not allow Mdm Dorothy to stay with them in their matrimonial flat. \r\n\r\nMdm Dorothy’s eldest daughter, Michelle, is a single individual who owns a flat at Bedok. She is presently accommodating Mdm Dorothy’s youngest daughter, Susanna, and her son who is suffering from brain tumour. It was reported that Mdm Dorothy share a strained relationship with Michelle. \r\n\r\nMdm Dorothy is presently homeless and would require accommodation/shelter support. \r\n\r\nAs Mdm Dorothy is rough sleeping in the public space for the first time, her current state of homelessness has resulted in her feeling highly anxious about her shelter needs. She reported feeling worried about not having a roof over her head. At the same time, she does not have a proper place for her basic hygiene needs, such as showering and changing of clothes. However, she denied having any suicidal or self-harm ideations at present. ",

(This was not possible due to her age + she did not fit the profile of residential homes as she was neither a juvenile delinquent nor an offender nor having at-risk behaviours.)\r\n\r\nLate Oct 2022 to 1 Dec 2022 - After much difficulty finding a landlord willing to rent a space to her for low cost, Pabitha and her mother found a place in Bukit Batok. Pabitha shared a rented room with 2-3 other females at any one time. Over this period, she witnessed violence and other incidents of concern that led to her feeling extremely unsafe. Hence, she contacted caseworker and asked for help with accommodation again.\r\n\r\n2 Dec 2022 - FSC caseworker facilitated Pabitha’s placement in Anglican Family Centre (crisis shelter).\r\n\r\nDec 2022 to Feb 2023 - Pabitha repeatedly failed to abide by shelter’s curfew rules. On multiple occasions, she also failed to seek permission before staying out at her friend’s house.\r\nAfter failing to heed the warnings issued by shelter, she was asked to leave AFC by 19 Feb 2023.\r\n\r\n19 Feb 2023 - FSC caseworker managed to get her a short term shelter in Bukit Panjang Methodist Church, where she has a few weeks' stay at maximum.

This is mainly due to his sensitivity with the smoking smell, where other stays there (at least 10 of them) smokes, and that contributed to his persistent headaches. This contributed to an increased stress where Alex further perceived the shelter as an unsafe environment for him to stay longer. As such, he hopes to explore alternative accommodation while pending the appeal to HDB for a rental flat. ",

    "reasons-for-homelessness": "Simon has been the subject of physical and emotional abuse at the hands of his own family for most of his life. I possess photo and video evidence of the most recent episode, which occurred on 15 October, and is tragically just one example of a very long history of abuse. \r\n\r\nAt the encouragement of my partner and myself, we accompanied Simon to lodge a police report and file medical records of this latest incident (report file number F/20211015/0178), to protect himself against any possible future attacks. At that point, he truly feared for his life, as his brother had turned so violent that he appeared to have intentions of smashing Simon with a glass panel (these actions were all captured on cctv footage). The photos I have attached (warning: graphic content) show the aftermath of his brother's attack, with injuries on Simon's body inflicted by a broom (which broke due to the force used to hit Simon).\r\n\r\nAs you can imagine, being abused at the hands of his immediate family has resulted in a very complicated and delicate situation. It was his family members who called the police on the morning of 26 October, and this resulted in Simon's detention at IMH to date. I managed to contact the IMH staff to have myself listed as the main point of contact for all subsequent updates, instead of his next-of-kin. \r\n\r\nSimon has OCD, depression and mild Tourette's syndrome, but he is of sound mind, and previously had a stellar work record at the Ministry of Manpower as a call centre officer. From 22 October to now, I have been actively helping Simon to find alternative lodging arrangements and employment, so that he can be a self-reliant and contributing member of society. This is also why I'm now reaching out to you as he needs a roof over his head temporarily until he gets something more permanent. \r\n\r\nSimon has suffered truly horrific treatment at the hands of those who are supposed to love and protect him, and we have reason to believe that they (the immediate family) are making a concerted effort to keep him locked away. I would greatly appreciate if you could help look into this case and give us any support you can muster, to help get Simon out of IMH and into a place he can be safe at temporarily. Despite what his family may say about him, he is an intelligent and articulate individual; someone who just wants to be in a supportive environment with people who can help him get his life on track.\r\n\r\nAs of today (23 Nov 2021), Adult Protective Services has reached out to me to discuss his discharge plans on where he can stay after he is released from IMH as they feel that his current home is too dangerous for him to return. I have until next Monday to find him a temporary accommodation.\r\n\r\nI would be glad to provide any support or additional information on this case. Please feel free to contact me anytime via this email address, or by phone at 9486 2743.\r\nThank you so much for your time, and I look forward to hearing back from you.",

She has depleted her savings over the past 10 years by renting from the open-market, as suggested by her HDB officer.  She is also ineligible for stays at S3Ps or transitional shelters due to her preference not to be vaccinated and not to take any Covid-19 ART or PCR tests, which is a regular regime at all S3Ps and shelters. Grace's preferences to not be vaccinated or take any Covid-19 diagnostic tests are due to her religious beliefs. She had stayed at S3P @ Bukit Panjang Methodist Church between September 2021 to October 2021, but had to leave as the S3P started regular Covid testing for residents.\r\n\r\nGrace has not been able to find suitable employment as her housing instability makes it difficult to maintain employment. She also prefers to find a job related to her training in counselling psychology, which she has difficulty finding. She has been doing odd jobs in the past few years for short stints.",

He has also previously been rejected by HDB in his application for a flat due to his wife being an LTVP holder, and currently transitional shelters are also assessing the couple's eligibility as Mdm Hee was just discharged from hospital after a fall that she suffered, and she requires assistance and a walking frame to move around. Client and his wife then checked in to a budget hostel since 30 April 2022, costing $1100 a month, as most cheaper hostels do not accept couples. \r\n\r\nDue to wife's LTVP status, her medical bills are not subsidized, and there is a large amount of outstanding bill with TTSH (in the region of 5 digits), which client is unable to pay off. Client currently only earns around $1300 a month as a cleaner, and has been tapping on his own savings to pay for his current accommodation. Furthermore, client's limited savings mean that he may not be able to stay beyond the month of May. Currently, FSC is working with MSF on waiving the criteria for the couple to apply for a HDB rental flat, but the outcome is unconfirmed yet.

He would reportedly go back to his sister's flat to get a quick shower before heading out to loiter at the void deck. ",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, he overstayed in Malaysia from April 2020 to May 2022 as the borders were closed. Now, he commutes regularly between Malaysia and Singapore for work since the borders reopened. He was often questioned about the period of overstay whenever he tries to re-enter Malaysia after work. On 8 December 2022, the Malaysia immigration authorities rejected his entry into Malaysia and he was barred for a period of 30 days. He is hence stuck in Singapore with little savings (approx. $500) and possessions for the next month. He plans to return to Malaysia once the period of 30 days is over. He is currently lodging at Fragrance Hotel for 1 night but does not have enough financial resources to sustain a 30 days-long stay.",
